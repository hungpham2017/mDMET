# pyDMET
Density matrix embedding theory for periodic/molecular systems

## Overview:
### 1. Notes: 
- The molecular DMET (mdmet) uses some of the functions in the QC-DMET <Copyright (C) 2015 Sebastian Wouters>
### 2. Features:
- Using overlap matrix to do Smith decomposition
- Using symmetry and multiple solvers
- single-embedding DMET (similar to CASCI=True in QC-DMET)
- New solvers: UHF, CASSCF

### 3. On progress:
- Smith decomposition for a UHF wavefunction
- Smith decomposition from a Kohn-Sham 1RDM
